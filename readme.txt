Dear Judges,

Hello! Our names are Claudia Haddad and Austin Mejia, and this is our project
for the MIT Hackathon. Our original idea was to create an app that would hold
all your friend's lunch schedules in it, so you would always have a friend to
eat with at lunch; sort of a find my friends for a meal. Simply put, we did not
make that app, and if we may be frank with you, it's been quite a weekend.

We spent 3 hours trying to get a GitHub repository set up, one of our
teammates left us in the middle of the competition (as in, she said she was
going to sit in on the IBM talk and never came back), Austin developed a sore
throat and got sick during the competition, the wifi jumped between working for
one of our computers to the other, and we had to navigate the troubles of
attending our first Hackathon.

So why are we telling you this? Two reasons: first, to explain to you why we are
still proud of our project. Either one of us could have made our final project
in four hours, and under normal conditions we wouldn't be too enthused about our
website. But given the unusual conditions we encountered, both of us take pride
in what we produced (we also plan on actually making our app after the hack is
over).

The second reason we decided to tell you this is because overall, we enjoyed
this experience. Yeah it was kind of awful for both of us, but we really learned
to stick together as a team, and we both feel that it only improved our mutual
trust in each other.

So please, take a look at our very messy, CSS heavy code. Because it's our code,
and we love it.
